# Computer Vision Based Deep Learning Models

## Introduction

This repository contains the code for the paper

The code is written in Python and uses the [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) framework. The models are trained on the [ImageNet](http://www.image-net.org/) dataset.

## Requirements

- Python 2.7
- TensorFlow 1.0
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- OpenCV

## Usage

### Downloading the dataset

Download the ImageNet dataset from [here](http://image-net.org/download-images).

### Training the models

To train the models, run the following command:

```
python train.py
```

This will train the models on the ImageNet dataset and save the trained models in the `models` directory.
