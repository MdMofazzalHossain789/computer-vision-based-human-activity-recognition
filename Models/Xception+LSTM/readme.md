# Improvement - 27 June 2025

## âœ… 1. **Data-Level Solutions**

#### a. **Data Augmentation**

- Apply spatial and temporal augmentations to increase diversity:

  - **Spatial:** random crop, flip, rotate, color jitter.
  - **Temporal:** frame skipping, sequence reversal, time warping.

- Helps simulate more data per class and reduce overfitting.

#### b. **Class Balancing**

- Ensure that all classes have similar number of samples.
- If some classes have fewer videos, consider **upsampling** or **synthetic data generation** (e.g., using GANs or video interpolation models).

#### c. **Use More Data**

- Increase total dataset size by:

  - Combining **multiple HAR datasets** (e.g., UCF50 + HMDB51).
  - Gathering new labeled video data if possible.

### âœ… 2. **Model-Level Solutions**

#### a. **Regularization**

- Increase **dropout** (if not already at maximum).
- Use **L2 regularization** (weight decay).
- Prevents overfitting especially when data is sparse.

#### b. **Transfer Learning**

- Freeze the Xception backbone and fine-tune only the LSTM and classifier layers.
- Pretrain on large-scale datasets (like Kinetics or ImageNet) to learn strong base features.

#### c. **Few-shot or Meta-Learning**

- Explore **Prototypical Networks**, **Relation Networks**, or **Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML)** for low-sample regimes.

---

### âœ… 3. **Training Strategy**

#### a. **Curriculum Learning**

- Start training with fewer classes or easier examples, gradually increasing difficulty.
- Helps the model learn robust low-level patterns first.

#### b. **Focal Loss (for class imbalance)**

- Focal loss helps the model focus more on hard-to-classify samples and less on well-classified ones.

```python
# Pseudo PyTorch Focal Loss
loss = -alpha * (1 - p_t)**gamma * log(p_t)
```

#### c. **Early Stopping & Learning Rate Scheduling**

- Avoid overfitting on smaller or noisy classes.
- Use ReduceLROnPlateau or cosine decay to adapt learning rate.

---

### âœ… 4. **Sequence-Level Solutions**

- Experiment with **sequence length**: maybe 20 frames isnâ€™t enough for complex actions.
- Use **attention mechanisms** (e.g., Transformer encoders) to let the model focus on key frames.

---

### âœ… 5. **Evaluation Strategy**

- Instead of accuracy alone, use **F1-score**, **confusion matrix**, or **top-k accuracy** to understand where generalization fails.

---

### ðŸ§  Example Action Plan for Your Case:

- âœ… Keep using 4â€“5 classes for baseline experiments.
- âœ… Then gradually increase to 10+ classes **with data augmentation**.
- âœ… Freeze Xception for small datasets, train only LSTM + FC.
- âœ… Consider replacing LSTM with **Transformer Encoder** for longer sequences.
